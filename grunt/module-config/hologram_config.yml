# Hologram will run from same directory where this config file resides
# All paths should be relative to there

# The directory containing the source files to parse recursively
source:
  - ./../../src/sass

# You may alternately specify multiple directories.
# source:
#  - ./sass
#  - ./library-sass

# The directory that hologram will build to
destination: ./../../src/styleguide

# The assets needed to build the docs (includes header.html,
# footer.html, etc)
# You may put doc related assets here too: images, css, etc.

#The path that contains supporting assets for the documentation page. This typically includes html fragments (header/footer, etc), style guide specific CSS, javascript and any images. Hologram specifically looks for two files: _header.html and _footer.html. These are used to start and end every html page hologram generates.
#Hologram treats _header.html and _footer.html as ERB files for each page that is generated. You can access the title, file_name, blocks, and categories.
#blocks is a list of each documentation block on the page. Each item in the list has a title, name, category, and optionally a parent. This is useful for, say, building a menu that lists each component.
#categories is a list of all the categories found in the documentation
#Nota Bene: Filenames that begin with underscores will not be copied into the destination folder.

documentation_assets: ./../../src/styleguide/doc_assets

# Any other asset folders that need to be copied to the destination
# folder. Typically this will include the css that you are trying to
# document. May also include additional folders as needed.
dependencies:
  - ./../../src/css

# Optional
# Mark which category should be the index page
# Alternatively, you may have an index.md in the documentation assets
# folder instead of specifying this config.
# index: Base CSS

# Optional
# To output navigation for top level sections, set the value to
# 'section'. To output navigation for sub-sections, set the value to `all`
nav_level: all

# Optional
# Hologram displays warnings when there are issues with your docs
# (e.g. if a component's parent is not found, if the _header.html and/or
#  _footer.html files aren't found)
# If you want Hologram to exit on these warnings, set the value to 'true'
# (Default value is 'false')
exit_on_warnings: false
