## Styleguide
Hologram styleguide will require Ruby but does have a Grunt plugin to build the styleguide.
It's pretty easy to setup and configure, if you follow the docs and the example.
You will need a Ruby dev kit for their MD parser. It's pretty painless to install.

Note: If you are having rendering issues on the styleguide output, try swapping hyphens for underscores in your files relating to this styleguide.
This worked for me after chasing back a handful of issues.
